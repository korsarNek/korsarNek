I have been a professional software developer for over 10 years, but I have been programming since I was 13 years old. I started with creating custom maps for Warcraft III - Frozen Throne, which I then played with friends and my brother. There, a lot could be done by just clicking together, but it was also the first time I used Lua and dealt with how to use a programming language.

Artistically, I used to enjoy drawing, have also painted acrylic paintings, and made statues out of soapstone and plaster. Later, 3D modeling was added, and today my 3D printers take over the craft part. I now do drawing with a tablet. Occasionally, I also build furniture out of wood, but I haven't quite got the knack of it yet.

In this blog, I will write about what currently interests me and what I want to share with others. The specific purpose is to show friends who seem to be interested in the things I do, the fact that it is publicly available on the internet is a side effect.
